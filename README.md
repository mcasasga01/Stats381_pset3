# Stats381_pset3
Problem set #3 for stats 381 

For this assignment, we needed to recreate the figure in Jeffrey, W. (2024). Intergenerational Educational( Im)mobility Among Those
Born in the United States, 1940 to 1990. https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231241271717. This publication did not include a replication package. 

For this assignment, I downloaded the variables directly from the GSS website. This data was uploaded as the file titled "gss.csv". Code for the data is under the file "Pset3.R". The final figure and my reflections on recreating a figure without a replication package are under "Pset3_Casas.docx".
